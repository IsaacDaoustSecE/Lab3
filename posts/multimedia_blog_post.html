                    <p>
                        <a href="https://discollect.app">Discollect</a> is a
                        website where you can collect albums by listening to
                        them on Spotify. These albums will then show on your
                        public profile for others to see. Whether you're into
                        classic rock, hip-hop, jazz, or electronic, Discollect
                        lets you build a personal album collection that reflects
                        your unique taste in music.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What makes this platform stand out is its integration
                        with Spotify—there's no need to manually add albums.
                        Simply listen, and Discollect will track your play
                        history, automatically adding albums to your collection
                        as soon as you’ve given them a proper listen. It’s more
                        than just a music library; it’s a reflection of your
                        listening journey.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Here's a sample...</h3>
                    <audio controls>
                        <source src="/audio/music.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
                        Your browser does not support the audio element.
                    </audio>

                    <p>
                        By curating your collection, you not only show off the
                        music you love but also discover what others are
                        listening to. Your public profile lets friends and
                        followers explore your tastes, find new albums, and even
                        see overlaps between their collections and yours.
                        Whether you're into uncovering hidden gems or keeping up
                        with the latest releases, Discollect makes it easy to
                        track your listening habits and share them with others.
                        Discollect is perfect for anyone who loves music and
                        wants to visualize their collection in a dynamic way.
                    </p>
